# To change the version of Node.js you would like to use for a project, create a new project directory mkdir
# NodeTest, and enter the directory cd NodeTest, then enter nvm use node to switch to the Current version,
# or nvm use --lts to switch to the LTS version. You can also use the specific number for any additional
# versions you've installed, like nvm use v8.2.1. (To list all of the versions of Node.js available, use
# the command: nvm ls-remote).

cd /mnt/c/Users/markj/sb/my_asreview/

# Install curl
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/master/install.sh | bash

# To verify installation. this should return nvm
command -v nvm

# List which versions of Node are currently installed (should be none at this point)
nvm ls

# Install the current stable LTS release of Node.js (recommended for production applications):
nvm install --lts

# Install the current release of Node.js (for testing latest Node.js features and improvements, but more likely to have issues)
nvm install node

# Now you should see the two versions that you just installed listed
nvm ls

# Verify that Node.js is installed and the currently default version
node --version

# Then verify that you have npm as well
npm --version

# Install ASReview in editable mode (Install .[dev] (whatever that is))
